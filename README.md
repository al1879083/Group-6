Concept:

A mobile app that allows the user to access information about their state representatives. And to also see what bills (by subject) are on the docket.
Our motivation for this app is to enhance the user participation in the political process. An informed public is an active public.

User Story:

As a voter or potential voter I would like quick information about my elected representatives and the bills in play.
 Where are their offices? 
 How do I contact them? 
 Description of bills.
